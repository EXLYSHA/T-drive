# T-drive-Taxi
This model implements a simple code for predicting the location of a taxi via Transformer. The model is implemented by predicting the next location through a window.

## Precautions
Limited by the computation time and loading speed of the model, I only used 10% of the data from the T-drive dataset for training and validation.
